git init-intizalise repo






edureka:

version-control: a system that managaes the changes to the documents in the form of versions.

--keeps your older versions safe so that you can go back to older versions.
--priovies shared workspace and notifies if someone makes a change to the project

--snapshots are properly stored.
--backup:

1.developers alwasys fetch copies  daily from central server to local system and transfer from the local to the central so its vice-cersa available.

2.notify you the changes made in the document and when the changes is amde.



version-control tool:

1.git
2.cvs
3.apache subversion
4.mercurial



git:version-control tool that allows operations like to fetch data from the central server,push data from the local to central.

repository:data space where you store the projects,files.

git-hub: code hosting platform .hosting service for git repository.hosts your central repository in a remote server.it can be compared to facebook.fb is a social network where people post photos,share videos.github-developers share their codes everyone to see their project.central server is located on remote server.

it is not good to automate using tools.it is always good to push the code when you want.


pros of dvcs:
1.no need of internet
2.always have a backup in local repo even if central repo crashes


git will help you in creating local repo and update all the files in remote repo.


feautures of git:
1.distributed:every developer has a local repo and changes can be made from one repo to the another.
 
2.few seconds to create and merger branches.

3.fetching data from local repo is 100 times faster than remote repo.

4.branch is like a pointer to the next commit

5.when system crash,you can recover the lost data from repo.



git operations and commands:


git init:initialise local repo.

readme:description of files in your repo


git add origin ""---for linkning to the remote repo-to add remote repo.

                ---you need to know which repo  you are pushing into.
